Didnt do 2.4 and 2.5. 2.4 has the weird problem where when you push into an array inside an array, other arrays also get the components. This was only observed in this specific array. In a controlled array called table the effect didnt occur, it worked well. 2.5 needs 2.4.': File name too long

maybe you concat: setNotes(notes.concat(noteObject)) ?
Or use state and setState for the array.


2.11 and onwards. If you want to start a server:
npm install -g json-server
json-server --port 3001 --watch db.json or npx json-server --port 3001 --watch db.json
You can now access http://localhost:3001/notes in the browser

fsm there is also another server thingy that is a shortcut but doesn't work for you:
npm run server
