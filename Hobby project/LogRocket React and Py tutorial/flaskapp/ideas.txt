An alternative, perhaps quicker approach to getting a wikipedia page in a smaller size is to first check for the
page number of the word (and whether it exists), then use this notation used by someone in a similar project on 
github:

https://en.wiktionary.org/w/api.php?action=query&titles=test&format=json 

retrieve page number/return that it doesnt exist and then look up:

 https://en.wiktionary.org/w/api.php?action=parse&format=json&prop=text|revid|displaytitle&callback=?&page= (page number goes here)
 
 ALERT! It doesnt seem to work for a large number of page numbers.
